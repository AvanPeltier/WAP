Watering and Planting is a project to create a plant waterer with a real time clock, pump, and a moisture sensor

The program follows I2C protocal to send start data to a clock that continually runs. Every week a relay is triggered to provide water for the plant.
Future expansion: moisture sensor will help prevent over-wartering and detect when water source is empty.
